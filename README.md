# Decentralized Voting System Smart Contract

Welcome to the Decentralized Voting System Smart Contract! This contract is a basic example of a decentralized voting system implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.

## Introduction

This smart contract allows users to create a decentralized voting system where candidates can be added, votes can be cast, and voting results can be tracked securely and transparently.

## Features

- Add candidates to the voting system.
- Cast votes for candidates.
- Retrieve the vote count for each candidate.
- Prevent duplicate voting by the same user.

## How It Works

1. Deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. The owner of the contract can add candidates who are eligible for voting.
3. Voters can cast their votes for their preferred candidates.
4. Each candidate's vote count is recorded and can be accessed publicly.
5. Once a voter casts a vote, they cannot vote again.
